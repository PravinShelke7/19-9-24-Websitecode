 <p class="FM_SeparatorsIX">Section III&#160;</p>
 <p class="FM_SeparatorX">Control Features</p>
 <p class="FM_Section"><a name="TOC_Section_III"></a>Section III:</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading1"><a name="TOC_Control_Featuresbc-1"></a><a name="TOC_Control_Features"></a>Control Features</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading2"><a name="TOC_A_Global_Managerbc-2"></a><a name="TOC_A_Global_Manager"></a>A. &#160;Global Manager</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText1">The Global Manager is the first screen you see after selecting and starting a module on the Universal Manager screen. &#160;It contains the highest level control features, and you should leave it open during your entire session. &#160;If you close the Global Manager, you will no longer have the ability to change and to manage your cases.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText1">There are two primary courses of action available to you on the Global Manager screen. &#160;You can start a case or start the Toolbox. &#160;These and other actions are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3">1. &#160;Starting Cases</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">One of the most important features provided by the Global Manager is the ability to start a case for review and analysis. &#160;As described previously, you can start two types of cases – base cases and proprietary cases. &#160;</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">Starting a base case</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Begin by selecting a case from the drop down menu located in the gray box labeled “Select from Available Base Cases.” &#160;Once you have selected the base case you’d like to start, submit your choice by clicking the “Start a Base Case” button just below the dropdown menu. &#160;When you start a case in this manner, the Case Manager appears in a new browser window with all the links necessary to examine your selected case.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">Starting a proprietary case</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Begin by selecting a case from the drop down menu located in the second gray box from the top labeled “Select from Available Proprietary Client Cases.” &#160;Once you have selected the proprietary case you’d like to start, submit your choice by clicking the “Start a Proprietary Case Analysis” button just below the dropdown menu. When you start a case in this manner, the Case Manager appears in a new browser window with all the links necessary to examine your selected case.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">2. &#160;Starting the Toolbox</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The Global Manager also provides access to the Toolbox. The Toolbox contains tools for high level case control including creating new cases, copying existing cases, deleting cases, sharing cases, synchronizing cases, and others.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">To start the Toolbox, scroll to the bottom of the Global Manager screen and find the button labeled “Go to Toolbox”. &#160;Click this button to open the Toolbox. &#160;The Toolbox will open in a new browser window.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">3. &#160;Starting the Case Viewer</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The Case Viewer is provided to assist with case selection. The Case Viewer provides a detailed description of each case in a convenient-to-browse format. </p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">Starting Base Case Viewer</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Begin by finding the link called “Case Viewer” in the gray base case box. &#160;Clink this link to open the Case Viewer, which provides a detailed description of each base case. &#160;&#160;The Case Viewer opens in a new browser window.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">Starting Proprietary Case Viewer</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Begin by finding the link called “Proprietary Case Viewer” in the grey proprietary case box. &#160;Clink this link to open the Case Viewer, which provides a detailed description of your proprietary cases. &#160;&#160;The Case Viewer opens in a new browser window.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading2step"><a name="TOC_B_Toolboxbc-3"></a><a name="TOC_B_Toolbox"></a>B. &#160;Toolbox</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText2">The Toolbox provides tools for key case management functions. &#160;These include creating cases, copying cases, and other functions that are described below. &#160;In addition, step by step procedures are provided for each Toolbox function in the next section of the manual.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3">1. &#160;Copy function</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The copy function creates a new case (the target case) in your proprietary space then copies all of the data from another case (the source case) into the new target case. &#160;You select the source case, which can be a base case or one of your proprietary cases. &#160;The system automatically creates and numbers the new target case.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the copy function has completed, a new window will open with a message verifying that the copy completed successfully and providing the case ID number of the new proprietary case.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">2. &#160;Transfer function</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The transfer function transfers all of the variables from a source case to an existing target case. &#160;The transfer function is similar to the copy function in that the copy and transfer functions move the same set of variables from one case to another. &#160;You select both the source and the target case for the transfer function.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the transfer function has completed, a new window will open with a message verifying that the transfer completed successfully and identifying the source and target case numbers.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">You can use the transfer function to transfer data to a target case that is blank (a brand new case) or one that is completely populated with data. &#160;In either situation, the data from the source case will be transferred to the target case. &#160;<span style="text-decoration : underline; "><u>As a result, you MUST double check the target case you have selected to ensure you do not copy over an existing case that you wish to keep</u></span>.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">3. &#160;Create function</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The create function creates and automatically numbers a new proprietary case. &#160;All of the data, including the case name and description, will be blank or zero for this new case.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the create function has completed, a new message window will open verifying that a new proprietary case was created successfully and providing you with the number of the new case.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">4. &#160;Delete function</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The delete function deletes the proprietary case that you have selected. &#160;<span style="text-decoration : underline; "><u>As a result, you MUST double check the target case you have selected to ensure you do not delete an existing case that you wish to keep</u></span>.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the case deletion function is completed, a new message window will open verifying that the proprietary case was deleted successfully.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">5. &#160;Rename</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The rename function provides the capability to change the name and description of proprietary cases. &#160;You select the target case.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the rename function is finished updating, a new message window will open verifying that the case descriptions were successfully updated and identifying the case effected.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">6. &#160;Share function</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The share function provides the capability to share access to a proprietary case or to share a copy of a proprietary case with a colleague. &#160;You can share your proprietary cases with other licensed users at your company.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">Share access</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The share access function allows you to share access to your proprietary cases. &#160;Shared access means all users are accessing the same case. &#160;Changes made by one user to a case shared by access are changed for all users.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the share access function has completed, a new message window will open verifying that the case has been shared successfully and identifying the user that received access.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading4">Share copy</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The share copy function allows you to share a copy of your proprietary cases with other licensed users at your company. &#160;Shared copy means all users receive their own copy of the source case. &#160;Changes made by one user to a case shared by copy are changed in their copy only.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the share copy function has completed, a new message window will open verifying that the case has been copied successfully and identifying the user that received the copy.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">7. &#160;Synchronize function</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The synchronize function transfers variables from one module to another. &#160;However, the synchronize function is carefully and automatically controlled to limit synchronization to transfers that make sense. &#160;It is possible to synchronize between Econ1 and Sustain1 modules. &#160;It is also possible to synchronize cases between Econ2 and Sustain2 modules. &#160;However, it is not possible to synchronize between Econ1 and Econ2 modules or Sustain1 and Sustain2 modules.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">&#160;&#160;The synchronize function is also limited to transferring data between cases having the same case ID number. &#160;Whenever a new case is created in one module, a corresponding case having the same case ID number is automatically created in the module that can be synchronized. &#160;For example, when a new proprietary case is created in Econ1, a corresponding proprietary case having the same case ID number is created in Sustain1.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Once the synchronization function has completed, a new window will open verifying that you have successfully synchronized and identifying the case number and the source and target modules.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading2step"><a name="TOC_C_Case_Managerbc-4"></a><a name="TOC_C_Case_Manager"></a>C. &#160;Case Manager</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText2">The Case Manager screen is the key screen for reviewing and examining individual cases. &#160;The Case Manager screen is the first screen that comes up after starting a case from the Global Manager screen. The Case Manager screen’s features are organized into four categories:</p>
 <p class="FM_Bullet2ss">• &#160;Assumptions screens</p>
 <p class="FM_Bullet2ss">• &#160;Intermediate results screens</p>
 <p class="FM_Bullet2ss">• &#160;Final results screens</p>
 <p class="FM_Bullet2ss">• &#160;Case Preferences screen</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3">1. &#160;Assumptions screens</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">Depending on which module you are working in, there are fourteen or fifteen assumption screens that are accessed from the Case Manager. &#160;The links to the Assumptions screens are found on the left hand column of the Case Manager screen under the “Specify Assumptions” heading. To access an assumption screen, click on the assumption page link you are interested in and that assumption page will open in a new window. &#160;When you are done working in the assumption page, close the window to return to the Case Manager. &#160;Note that each assumption page must be accessed and filled out correctly in order for the system to calculate results. The instructions for filling out each assumption page are provided in later sections of this manual.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">&#160;It is generally not going to be necessary for you to fill out all of the assumptions on each assumption page. &#160;SavvyPack Corporation provides pre-researched Base Cases that you can copy into your proprietary space using the copy tools in the Toolbox. &#160;Using this strategy, you then have a case in your proprietary space with the assumptions pages filled out. &#160;At this point, you only need to modify the assumptions necessary to create a case that models the specific package or process you are interested in. </p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">2. &#160;Intermediate results screens</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">From the Case Manager, you can also access intermediate results pages. &#160;The intermediate results pages serve two primary purposes. &#160;First, they create transparency within the SavvyPack@ System by showing intermediate results, which make it easy to understand the underlying calculations. &#160;Second, they allow you to gauge whether the assumptions you have entered are reasonable based on the intermediate results. &#160;Specific instructions on how to use the intermediate results pages are found in later sections of this manual.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">The intermediate results pages are found in the middle column of the Case Manager screen under the heading “Review Intermediate Results”. &#160;To access an intermediate results page, click the link and the page will open in a new window. &#160;When you are done with intermediate results page, close the window to return to the Case Manager screen.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">3. &#160;Final results screens</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">From the Case Manager screen, you can also access the final results pages. &#160;The final results pages are the primary outputs of the SavvyPack system. &#160;For the Econ1 and Econ2 modules, the final results pages consist of a pro-forma profit and loss sheet with or without depreciation, a cost sheet with or without depreciation, and a case summary page that summarizes key assumptions and results for printing. &#160;For Sustain1 and Sustain2, the final results pages consist of energy consumption, greenhouse gas releases, end-of-life, scorecard results, and a case summary page. &#160;The final results pages also include a link to a compare feature that makes it possible to compare cases, both in tables and with graphs.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">To access the Final Results pages, click the link to the results page you are interested in located beneath the “Review Final Results” heading. &#160;The final results page you select will open in a new window. &#160;When you are done with the page, close the window to return to the Case Manager screen. &#160;&#160;Specific instructions on how to use each Final Results page are provided in later sections of this manual.</p>
 <p class="FM_Heading3step">4. &#160;Case Preferences screen</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">From the Case Manager screen, you can also access the Case Preferences page. &#160;The Case Preferences page is important because you make selections on the Case Preferences page that impact the entire case. &#160;On the Case Preferences page you select the effective date for material prices, energy rates, labor rates, and currency conversion rates. &#160;You also select the units (Metric or English) and the currency you wish to work in. &#160;You also select the country of manufacture.</p>
 <p class="FM_BodyText3">To access the Case Preferences page, click the “Preferences” link above the “Review Intermediate Results” heading. &#160;The Case Preferences page opens in a new window. &#160;Once you are done with the Case Preferences page, close the window to return to the Case Manager screen. &#160;Specific instructions for the Case Preferences page are provided in later sections of this manual. </p>
